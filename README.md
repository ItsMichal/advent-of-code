# Advent of Code Solutions

This year I'm doing advent of code. I'm gonna start off just doing things in Python but if I have more time some days I'll do some extra challenges in new languages.

Definitely want to make a webapp, rust, assembly solution for at least a few of the days.

Attempted to speedcode. Did not go too well! Will try again on another day for better rankings.

Solved in `dayfive.ipynb`. Documented my solution to Part 2 which was "fun" as it wasn't brute-forceable! 

Don't love my Part 2 time though... oh well!
